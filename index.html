        <p>With origins dating back to the 1600's in Spain, the cowboyboot as we know it first appeared in the wild west of the U.S. in the early 1800's. Traditionally worn by cowboys and ranchers, the cowboy boot has become a staple in the fashion industry.</p>

        <p>There are many styles to this traditional boot. The toe shape can range from square, round, even snipped. Typically the shaft of the boot is between eight and twelve inches high. Most cowboy boots are made from cowhide but can be found in other exodic materials such as alligator or snake skin. </p>

        <p>The cowboy boot may seem all fashion these days, but even the decorative stiching serves a purpose. The stiching helps keep the leather from folding over. All of those decorative egals and patters are helping to keep the boot safely on your leg.</p>
